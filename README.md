# bayesian_kinetics

## Code for Rix et al. 2020.

### Required packages
- python >= 3.6
- numpy
- pandas
- pystan (>= 2.19.0.0)
- bokeh
- scipy
- statsmodels
- jupyterlab

See the jupyter notebook html (`example_notebook.html`) for specific background and examples. Once downloaded, it can be redered directly in a browser, no jupyter (or python) necessary, if you'd like to read through and see the examples without needing to run them.

Over time this repo will be updated to be a more general resource, while still retaining the paper-specific code.
